# 	"""Class for documenting the reference frame of vectors.
	
# 	By adding :class:`mirage.utility.Vector2D` to :class:`ReferenceFrame`
# 	instances you can bind the vectors to the frame.
# 	:class:`ReferenceFrame` then includes methods to transform vectors from
# 	one reference frame to another. Reference frames are constructed by
# 	passing in unit vectors.
