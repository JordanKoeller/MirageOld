Model that Star, with the new parameters:
	Will need to look at the paper for details of the system/quasar size/etc
	100 theta_e across screen
	10% mass in stars
	sources of size 2 - 50 R_g of BH
	save light curve, along with movie of moving source. Magmap if possible
	
	
Memory profiling:
	find where memory going, so can push number of rays to trace
	GOOD WAY TO START
		Jumps up to max after calling build_data. Maybe optimize the Grid???

Experiment Queue
	Finish, more parameters to specify, can flesh out in the 1-run case

	
Write functions to give stars velocity from a gaussian of velocities (specify peak, sigma) - 3D, so need to project to 2D

Pixel scale in terms of angle (uas), theta_e of 0.5 M_sol point lenser, and R_g of quasar ------------------------------------DONE, NEEDS TESTING
