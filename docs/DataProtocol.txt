An experiment Data File is as follows:
	
'.sim' extension
NONCOMPRESSED. Compressed at the end upon closing the file. Not upon writing each part

Layout:

FILE HEAD
pickled parameters file
	--Includes the special parameters for the experiment
	--Includes the name, description, number of trials, etc.
	--Includes specification of magnification map for entire experiment, per-trial basis, or other
.npy np.ndarray[np.int64_t, ndim={specified by parameters}] 
	--array is of numtrials length
	--upon initial writing, is all zeros
	--after end of experiment, updated with head position of the file, relative to SEEK_HEAD.
		--This way, can index to a specific trial just like an array by SEEKing to that position relative to SEEK_HEAD
	--different dimensions specify the number of arrays necessary to express a trial
	--key for what each array means is is the pickled parameters instance
		--Options are:
			--light curve
			--fits data for mag map
			--starfield data

FILE DATA
All the .npy data for each trial.
	--specified in the parameters file, what each array is.
