report average mass of starfield, use for determining theta_e				DONE


Relative velocities
Track image through magmap - transparent data for lightcurve 
    multipane animation
determine and use avg mass of stardist as theta_e mass
licensing info, etc
scale coloring of magmap relative to magnification without point lenses
Remote plotting to fix race condition?
Generate light curve from magmap pixel values
